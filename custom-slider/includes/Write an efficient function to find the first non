Write an efficient function to find the first non repeated character in a string. For instance, the first non repeated character in “total” is 'o' and the first non repeated character in “teeter” is 'r'.


function NonrepetedString($string){
	//$pos = strpos($string,1);
	$pos1 = explode($pos);
	$i=0;
	foreach($pos1[$i]){
	$char = $pos1[$i];
	if($char === $pos1[$i]){
	echo "matched";

	}
	else{
	echo "";
	}
	}
	

}
